# Lab - React library research

This lab is going to give you the opportunity to do some research on a library and present to your classmates.

## What is a Library and why should we use them?

There are a billion webpages, and many of them are interactive in some way - in fact, many of them are interactive in the same ways. How many websites have you seen that use a slideshow? I've seen hundreds, myself!

Now, it's possible that every one of those web developers wrote their own JavaScript code to make a slideshow, but a lot of them probably re-used the same code. As programmers, we should re-use existing code when we can, so that we don't waste our time writing code that another programmer has already written.

In JavaScript, the way we do that is by using a library. A library is a JavaScript file that contains a bunch of functions, and those functions accomplish some useful task for your webpage.

#### How do we know what functions we can use?

We could look at the JavaScript file, if it's short, or better, we could look at the `documentation`. Most libraries have documentation with a list of available functions or real-world examples.

All of these Libraries can be used in any JavaScript application even ones built in React, Vue or Angular.

But in certain cases there may be multiple versions or extensions of the Library that have been written to work better with React.

For example there is a Map library called `Leaflet` but there is also a library called `react-leaflet`. There is a CSS library called `Bootstrap` but also a `react-bootstrap` library. 

In these cases you will install the core library and the install the React version on top of it.

So when you are choosing a library to use make sure you check if there is a React specific version/extension that you can use.


## Task

Each pair/group will be asked to do some research on a library and build something small using that Library. Then give a 5(ish) minute presentation to the rest of the class, based on what they have learned in their research.

You have a choice of topics to research. Decide in your group which you want to research and present on.

## The Choices:

### 1) Leaflet

Leaflet is a Map library used to display maps, add markers, waypoints, etc.

https://react-leaflet.js.org/

### 2) Charts

Simple, immersive and interactive charts for React

React Charts: Simple, immersive and interactive charts for React

React Visx: collection of reusable low-level visualization components
https://github.com/airbnb/visx

Nivo: rich set of dataviz components, built on top of the awesome d3 and Reactjs libraries.

### 3) CSS

There are numerous CSS libraries that offer different ways to style the app. From implementing custon CSS to using pre-built and styled components.

- Styled Components: Use the best bits of ES6 and CSS to style your apps without stress

- Material UI: React components for faster and easier web development.

- Tailwind UI: Fully responsive HTML components

### 4) Animations

Custom animations for your React app

react-spring: bring your components to life with simple spring animation primitives

react-motion:

## Finding Information

There are lots of resources on the web for all topics.  Feel free to use information from more than one website - this is a good sign that you can research for information and collate it.
